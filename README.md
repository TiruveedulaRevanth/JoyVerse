# JoyVerse
In the current world, leveraging technology to create personalized and adaptive learning experiences
is key to supporting diverse learning needs. Dyslexic children, in particular, benefit greatly from
tailored educational interventions that keep them engaged and motivated.
JoyVerse is a transformer-powered system, which can analyze video feeds of dyslexic children
playing educational games to detect their emotional states.
This will require building state-of-the-art transformers for facial expression recognition and temporal
sentiment modeling, enabling real-time optimization of game design elements such as difficulty levels,
themes, and reward systems, ultimately creating a more effective and enjoyable learning environment.
All adjustments and optimizations will be made in alignment with the therapist's guidance, ensuring
the tool remains within the boundaries of recommended therapeutic approaches
